# About the project

This project constructed a [demo movie recommendation system](https://hzhong.shinyapps.io/movierecommender/) through shiny app 
upon [movielens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) dataset. To solve the cold start problem, an adaptive
bootstrapping process was performed to find movies that best split people of different interest into subgroups to
gain the first batch data of users. User-based collaborative filtering was implemented to recommend movies for new
users.
